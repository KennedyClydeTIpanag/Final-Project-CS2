# 📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

## 📝 Project Title  


## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Objective 1: To organize the medical records of the patients.
Objective 2: To provide healthcare profesionals with easy access to each patient's medical history.
Objevtive 3: To analyze trends across patients (e.g, common diagnoses, medication given, frequency of visits)


## 🔍 Problem Statement  
A hospital records 4 patient's visit date, diagnosis, treatment, the doctor that treated them, and the doctor's notes on each of them. Symptoms of each patient seem to come back after a certain amount of time after the treatment. Solving this would lead to less frequent visits from the sick and less loss of resources. If we don't solve this problem then this can lead to delayed care, medication errors, and poor health outcomes. This pattern is shown in the dataset, where each patient has multiple visits for the same condition.
