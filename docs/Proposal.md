# 📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

## 📝 Project Title  


## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Objective 1: To organize the medical records of the patients.
Objective 2: To provide healthcare profesionals with easy access to each patient's medical history.
Objevtive 3: To analyze trends across patients (e.g, common diagnoses, medication given, frequency of visits)


## 🔍 Problem Statement  
A hospital records 4 patient's visit date, diagnosis, treatment, the doctor that treated them, and the doctor's notes on each of them. Symptoms of each patient seem to come back after a certain amount of time after the treatment. Solving this would lead to less frequent visits from the sick and less loss of resources. If we don't solve this problem then this can lead to delayed care, medication errors, and poor health outcomes. This pattern is shown in the dataset, where each patient has multiple visits for the same condition.

## ⚙️ Planned Features  
Feature #1 : EHR - The EHR (Electronic Health Record) is for organizing medical records, storing them, etc. This feature is basically for managing the medical records.
Feature #2 : Charts - Gives a visual interpretation for the data.
Feature #3 : Storage for the data - Data is saved. When deleted, you still have to access another storage to permanently delete it. If the decision is to not delete it permanently, then the data can still be restored. Corrupted data can be restored since this feature serves as a backup storage too.
Feature #4 : Security - When these security measures are implemented, it lessens the risk of corruption (if possible, it can be restored by feature #3) and invasion of a patient's privacy.
Feature #5 : Analytics - It is what collects and analyzes the data.
